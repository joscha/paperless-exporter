# paperless-exporter

Export from Mariner Paperless app to
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)-compatible Markdown.

## Instructions/Assumptions

- Your library is NOT encrypted. If it is encrypted you need to remove
  the encryption with your password through the app first.

I thoroughly recommend making a backup/copy of you library before
you mess with it in any way.

## Limitations

There are probably other limitations in this utility.
This exports only a subset of all fields.

Pull requests are of course welcome.
