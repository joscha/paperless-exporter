## Instructions/Assumptions

- Your library is NOT encrypted. If it is encrypted you need to remove
  the encryption with your password through the app first.

I thoroughly recommend making a backup/copy of you library before
you mess with it in any way.

## Limitations

* This exports only a subset of all fields.
